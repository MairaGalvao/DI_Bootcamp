Follow the instructions below to determine which columns to add to the two tables:

Add the following items to the items table:
Small Desk – 100 (ie. price)
Large desk – 300
Fan – 80


CREATE TABLE my_customers (
    full_name VARCHAR (255) 
) 


Add 5 new customers to the customers table:
Greg Jones
Sandra Jones
Scott Scott
Trevor Green
Melanie Johnson

CREATE TABLE my_items (
    furniture VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC (10) NOT NULL
); 


Use SQL to fetch the following data from the database:
All the items.
select * from my_items
select * from my_customers

All the items with a price above 80 (80 not included).
SELECT * FROM my_items WHERE price > 80;

All the items with a price below 300. (300 included)
SELECT * FROM my_items WHERE price <= 300;

All customers whose last name is ‘Smith’ (What will be your outcome?).
SELECT * FROM my_customers where full_name LIKE '%Smith'

All customers whose last name is ‘Jones’.
SELECT * FROM my_customers 
WHERE full_name LIKE '%Jones'

All customers whose firstname is not ‘Scott’.
SELECT * FROM my_customers 
WHERE NOT full_name LIKE ('Scott%')
