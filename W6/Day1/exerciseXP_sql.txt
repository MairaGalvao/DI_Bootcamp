Creating a table for customers:
CREATE TABLE my_customers (
    full_name VARCHAR (255) 
) 


Creating a table for items:
CREATE TABLE my_items (
    furniture VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC (10) NOT NULL
); 


Adding columns and rows to customers:
INSERT INTO my_customers (full_name)
VALUES
    ('Greg Jones'),
    ('Sandra Jones'),
	('Scott Scott'),
	('Trevor Green'),
	('Melanie Johnson');


Adding columns and rows to items:
INSERT INTO my_items (price,furniture)
VALUES
    (100, 'small desk'),
    (300, 'large desk'),
	(80, 'fan');

Selecting all items from both tables:
SELECT * FROM my_items;
SELECT * FROM my_customers;

All the items with a price above 80 (80 not included):
SELECT * FROM my_items WHERE price > 80;

All the items with a price below 300. (300 included):
SELECT * FROM my_items WHERE price <= 300;


All customers whose last name is ‘Smith’ (What will be your outcome?). OUTCOME = NOTHING
SELECT * FROM my_customers 
WHERE full_name LIKE 'Smith'

All customers whose last name is ‘Jones’:
SELECT * FROM my_customers 
WHERE full_name LIKE '%Jones'

All customers whose firstname is not ‘Scott’:
SELECT * FROM my_customers 
WHERE NOT full_name LIKE ('Scott%')
