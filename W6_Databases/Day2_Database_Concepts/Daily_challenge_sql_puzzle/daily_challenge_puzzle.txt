CREATE TABLE FirstTab (
     id integer, 
     name VARCHAR(10)
)

INSERT INTO FirstTab VALUES
(5,'Pawan'),
(6,'Sharlee'),
(7,'Krish'),
(NULL,'Avtaar')

SELECT * FROM FirstTab

CREATE TABLE SecondTab (
    id integer 
)

INSERT INTO SecondTab VALUES
(5),
(NULL)


SELECT * FROM SecondTab

QUESTIONS:

Q1. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL )
FirstTab would be now named AS ft, it selects the count of each row (only on the id column), then it selects on the SecondTab table where the id is null.
So it gives ONE ROW as answer. 

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 )
FirstTab would be now named AS ft, where ft.id is not in the SecondTab on the id 5.
It gives the result as count 1 in the id of 2.

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )
It gives an amount of 2 as counting in both tables there are 2 outputs as NULL in the rows
